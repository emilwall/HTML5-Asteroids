Asteroids
=========

To run the game, simply open index.html in a browser that supports html5 canvas.

Tests
-----

The tests are designed to run with JsTestDriver with a Jasmine plugin.

To run the tests locally on your computer:
- Dedicate a terminal (or a tab in your terminal) to run the command *java -jar bin/JsTestDriver-1.3.5.jar --port 9999*
- Open one or several browsers and navigate to *localhost:9999/*
- Run *java -jar bin/JsTestDriver-1.3.5.jar --tests all* in a terminal
- To run only a subset of the tests, replace *all* with a suitable regexp to match the test names
