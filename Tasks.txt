Tasks:
* Implement hyperspace, causing the ship to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid, as in the original game).
* Implement shield that protects the ship and destroys objects when activated. It should have limited energy so it can be activated for a total of 5 seconds, then the function fall back to hyperspace. Half amount of points are awarded for destroying an object with the shield compared to bullet.
* Add a display bar, counter or similar to display energy left for the shield
* Allow the energy to recharge after a couple of seconds of use, or with each hit, up to the maximum
* Do not preserve momentum of the ship when moving
* Add new type of alien ship, SmallAlien. It should be smaller, move faster, and aim at the player ship, but fire much less often (and always aim directly at the player, not across the boundaries, just as in the original game).
* Enable weapon upgrade that allows for automatic fire when holding space
* Enable weapon upgrade that fires three bullets at once in a spread out manner
* Enable multiplayer using separate controls for the players
* Add a menu system to set controls before starting the game
* Add a high score table
* Ensure that the maximum number of big asteroids that are generated is 12
* Reproduce the "turn over"-bug of the original game -- Make the maximum possible score 99,990 points, after which it "rolls over" back to zero -- as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)
